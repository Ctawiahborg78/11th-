    <p>
      Dear God,
      <br><br>
      We thank You for bringing us together and for eleven wonderful months of love and joy. We ask for Your continued blessings on our relationship. May we always find strength in each other and grow closer with each passing day. Thank You for the laughter, the adventures, and the quiet moments we share. Help us to always communicate openly and honestly, to support each other in our dreams, and to cherish the love that binds us. We pray that you continue to guide us and bring us together. We pray you continue to protect us spriritually, mentally, and physically. We pray you continue to bless us with the love we have for each other and continue to bless us with your blessings and your grace forever and ever. Thank you Lord.
      
      <br><br>
      Amen.
